## Dynamic Programming

Some perspectives or ways of "thinking about it"
* Careful bruteforce
* Guessing + recursion + memoization
* Basically "always computing shortest paths in a DAG"
* Can also be thought of as a linear program solution

### Five easy steps to Dynamic Programming

1. define *subproblems*
2. guess (part of solution)
3. relate *subproblem solutions*
4. recurse & memoize
  - Or build table bottom-up
5. solve original problem
